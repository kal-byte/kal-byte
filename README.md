Hi I'm kal (Short for Kallum) and I've been playing around with Python since around 2018 and I've been having a lot of fun with it. Primarily I work with chat-bots, more notably discord bots with the discord.py wrapper which I've been having fun with. Also I enjoy working with web apps and such.
I'll be working on a lot more stuff as I go on.
