## Who am I?
### I'm a 16 year old who programs in Python and very occasionally JavaScript. Currently I work and maintain a discord bot that goes under the name of "Platform" You can find the repository [here][platform_github], I've rewritten and redone a lot of the code and it has generally been a little learning experience for me, I've had about 3-4 years of Python experience prior to making discord bots and it definitely has helped me out a lot.

- Where did I learn programming?
    - School
    - Youtube
    - Sites such as w3schools

I'll update this as more stuff goes on.
